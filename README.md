# Financial Labelling

## Overview
**Financial Labelling** is a research-oriented project that explores the use of **meta-labelling** to improve the quality of trading signals.  
The project demonstrates how to combine a simple trading strategy (based on Bollinger Bands) with **Triple-Barrier Labelling** and machine learning models to filter, calibrate, and enhance raw signals.  
The framework provides both reusable code modules and reproducible experiments in Jupyter notebooks.

## ✨ Features
- **Triple-Barrier Labelling**  
  Implementation of López de Prado’s labelling technique for financial time series.  

- **Meta-Labelling Framework**  
  Demonstrates how a meta-model can filter and improve base strategy signals.  

- **Example Trading Strategy**  
  A simple Bollinger-based strategy with short-term moving average and persistence filter, used as the baseline.  

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking — all trained with calibrated probabilities and validated using **TimeSeriesEmbargoCV** to prevent information leakage between folds.  

- **Embargo Cross-Validation**  
  Custom **TimeSeriesEmbargoCV** implementation adds an embargo period between training and test sets, ensuring realistic evaluation in time-series data.  

- **Backtesting**  
  Vectorbt-based portfolio simulation comparing raw signals against meta-model enhanced signals.

## ▶️ Usage

- **Triple-Barrier Labelling**  
  Open `notebooks/00_TripleBarrierLabel.ipynb` to see how the `TripleBarrierLabel` object is applied to raw price data in order to generate event labels (+1, 0, -1).  

- **Meta-Labelling**  
  In `notebooks/01_MetaLabelling.ipynb`, a simple Bollinger-based trading strategy is combined with triple-barrier labels to create a binary target, and several ML models are trained to predict the reliability of the signals.  

- **Backtesting**  
  The notebooks also include a backtesting workflow using **vectorbt**, allowing comparison between the base strategy and the meta-model enhanced strategy (including position sizing based on predicted probabilities).

## 🔮 Future Work

Possible extensions for this project include:

- Adaptation of the code to work with **Imbalance Volume Bars (IVB)** and other non-time-based bars.  
- Training the meta-model on a **cluster of assets** in order to improve its generalization capability.
